## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: close() invokes every registered close handler

`BaseStream.close()` SHALL call every registered close handler, in the order they were registered, with no arguments. If one or more close handlers raise an exception, `close()` SHALL still invoke every remaining handler before raising; it SHALL NOT stop invoking handlers because an earlier handler raised. After all handlers have run, if any raised, `close()` SHALL raise the first exception that was raised, in encounter order.

#### Scenario: close() with no handlers registered

- **WHEN** `close()` is called on a stream with no close handlers registered
- **THEN** no error is raised and nothing is invoked

#### Scenario: close() invokes all handlers in registration order

- **WHEN** `close()` is called on a stream with multiple close handlers registered
- **THEN** every handler is called exactly once, in the order they were registered

#### Scenario: A raising handler does not prevent later handlers from running

- **WHEN** `close()` is called on a stream with handlers `[bad, good]` registered in that order, and `bad` raises an exception when called
- **THEN** `good` is still called, and `close()` raises `bad`'s exception after both handlers have run

#### Scenario: Multiple raising handlers still all run, and the first exception is raised

- **WHEN** `close()` is called on a stream with handlers `[bad_a, bad_b]` registered in that order, both of which raise when called
- **THEN** both `bad_a` and `bad_b` are called, and `close()` raises `bad_a`'s exception (the first one encountered)
